# UnlimitedFlight 
A tera-proxy module that lets you fly endlessly.  
  
## Usage  
While in game, open a proxy chat session by typing "/proxy" or "/8" in chat and hitting the space bar.  
This serves as the script's command interface.  
The following commands are supported:  
  
* fly - enable/disable UnlimitedFlight  
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to the proxy chat in game is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
This is obviously one of the more questionable modules, so I do not recommend using it around players you don't trust.
